# Machine-learned potentials for atomistic simulations

Over the last two decades, a drastic change has emerged in the way we simulate atomistic systems. Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have enabled *ab-initio*-level accuracy in force and energy predictions for a fraction of the price associated with traditional methods. We can now access systems of a size and complexity that were previously unamenable to accurate simulation. An overview of some of the major MLP developments and achievements can be found here: ...

At the forefront of MLP development is the multi atomic cluster expansion (MACE) potential [ref]. Developed in 2022, this potential combines a complete high body order polynomial basis with a message-passing tensor network to enable faithful representations of local chemical envionrments and to reproduce rerference *ab initio* energies and forces.
