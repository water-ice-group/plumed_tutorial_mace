# Using MACE to run umbrella sampling over a single CV

Now we can run some simple MD, let's add in some enhanced sampling. Specifically, in this section, we will be using PLUMED to drive a conformational change in our carbonic acid molecule. 

In the folder `task_2`, look at the file `mace.py` and notice the following addition:
